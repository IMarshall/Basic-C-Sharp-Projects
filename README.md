 A repository to store my projects from the C# and .NET Tech Academy course.

## Projects
Here are a few of the larger projects that I worked on:
- [Car Insurance](#car-insurace)
- [Blackjack](#blackjack-twenty-one-console-game)

### [Car Insurace](/CarInsurance/)
This is an MVC web application that mimics a car insurance website. It has the user fill out policy information and calculates a quote based on business logic using factors such as age, car details (year, make, model), speeding tickets, etc. User info and quotes are saved in a database using ADO.NET. Basic CRUD functionality is available for each database entry. It also includes an admin page that allows staff to view all of the quotes that have been issued with contact information attached to them. All views are built using Razor syntax.

### [Blackjack (Twenty One) Console Game](/TwentyOne/)
This is a console application that simulates a game of blackjack. A deck of cards is built, shuffled, and dealt between the player and the dealer. The player can specify how much money they start with and how much they bet on each hand. The dealer follows the standard dealer rules for a game of blackjack. It was built using the .NET framework. It also records timestamps and info for each car dealt to a text file for future reference.
